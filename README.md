# RT-Stat

A real time statistics (hence the RT-Stat) plugin for the Open Ephys plugin-GUI. The module calculates statistics on the firing rates of sorted neurons. The mean and standard deviation are calculated per each neuron, and a histogram is generated. The module has the option of sending out a TTL event when a neuron hits a user-specified threshold. Details regarading the use and feel of the plugin can be found below.
