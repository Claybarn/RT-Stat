# RT-Stat

A real time statistics (hence the RT-Stat) plugin module for the Open Ephys plugin-GUI. The module calculates statistics on the firing rates of sorted neurons. The mean and standard deviation are calculated per each neuron. The module has the option of sending out a TTL event when a neuron hits a user-specified threshold.

To-do:
1. Save data
2. Plot mean, standard deviation and TTL signal threshold on histogram.
